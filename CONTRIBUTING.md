# Contributing

We are always welcome your contribution!

## How to contribute

### Find the tasks

We use GitHub issues to manage the tasks. Please find the issues you'd like to contribute to it. `welcome contribute` and `easy` are good for the first contribution.

Of course, it would be great to send PullRequest which has no issue! However, please explain the motivation, the cause, the solution and so on in the description of the PR then.

### Start contributing

If you find the tasks you want to contribute, please comment on the issue to prevent to conflict contribution. We'll reply as soon as possible, but it's unnecessary to wait for our reaction if you have raised voice. It's okay to start contribution and send PullRequest!

We've designated these issues as good candidates for easy contribution. You can always fork the repository and send a pull request (on a branch other than master).

## How to submit a proposal or start a discussion

Issues are preferable, but PRs are also welcome if you have a concrete idea to implement/refactoring something. 

## Languages

We use English for issues, comments, and reviews.

English is preferable though; it would be okay in Japanese if you do not want to use English for some reasons. 
Unfortunately, only Japanese and English are acceptable for us because of our language ability. Thank you for your understanding. JFYI, We at DroidKaigi Committee consists of Japanese speakers and English speakers. 

For non-English speakers, some of DroidKaigi Committee members are not fluent English speakers so don't be afraid of communicating in English. :)

## NOTE

Please don't hesitate to ask questions. 

We would like you to enjoy contributions, learn many things, share your knowledge and enjoy DroidKaigi. Thanks.
